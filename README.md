# IASA - Implementation and Evaluation

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the IASA algorithm along with evaluation frameworks for both the proposed method and baseline approaches.

## Repository Structure

- `eval.py`: Main entry point for the evaluation framework
- `rs_attack_section/`: Contains the core implementation of the IASA algorithm
- `eval_base/`: Implements evaluation for baseline methods
- `assets/`: Contains visual resources, including the algorithm flow chart

## Algorithm Flow

The IASA algorithm implementation follows the flow chart as illustrated below:
