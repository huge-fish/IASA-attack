IASA - Implementation and Evaluation
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the IASA algorithm along with evaluation frameworks for both the proposed method and baseline approaches.

Repository Structure
eval.py: Main entry point for the evaluation framework
rs_attack_section/: Contains the core implementation of the IASA algorithm
eval_base/: Implements evaluation for baseline methods
assets/: Contains visual resources, including the algorithm flow chart
Algorithm Flow
The IASA algorithm implementation follows the flow chart as illustrated below:

Getting Started
Prerequisites
# Required dependencies will be listed here
Installation
git clone https://github.com/username/IASA.git
cd IASA
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the evaluation:

python eval.py --param1 value1 --param2 value2
For baseline evaluation:

python eval_base/run.py
Implementation Details
The core algorithm is implemented in the rs_attack_section directory, which contains:

Algorithm initialization
Processing pipeline
Evaluation metrics
